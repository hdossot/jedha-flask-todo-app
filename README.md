# To Do List Flask Application

This repository gathers all pieces of codes produced to create a To do list application using Flask Framework

## Objective
The objective of the application is to propose an UI in order to allow the user to save list of topics he want to remind.
This application is built with a Docker image so it eases the deployment in production.

### Quick Start : 
- The source code is written in Python 3.
- The python packages can be installed with pip : `pip3 install -R requirements.txt` to install Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, SQLAlchemy, gunicorn
- To launch Flask server : launch command "python app.py" (Ctrl-C pour terminer le serveur)

## Prerequisites
- Need to build Docker image and have Docker install in the production server

## Team contributors
The base code of this app was developed during Jedha Bootcamp and customizes on my own
